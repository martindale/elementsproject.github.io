ElementsProject.org
===================

Welcome to the Elements Project.  We're excited you're here, and want to
collaborate with you on making Elements accessible to anyone who will find
utility in their use.

## Quick Start
ElementsProject.org is a static website powered by [Hexo](https://hexo.io).
You'll need `npm` (which comes with Node.js) to get started.

First, install hexo: `npm install hexo-cli -g`

Fork the repository (top right hand corner on GitHub), and get a local copy:
```
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/elementsproject.org # clone the repo
cd elementsproject.org # move into the directory
```

Now, you can use Hexo to run a local copy to preview your changes:
```
hexo server
```

That's it.  Make modifications, commit them, and submit a pull request.
