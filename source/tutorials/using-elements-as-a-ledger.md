Elements offers a complete implementation of a blockchain, which is a form of
distributed ledger.  However, not all use-cases require a distributed system â€”

In this tutorial, we will explore using Elements as a basic ledger in a
single-signer configuration, which can serve as a digital asset database for
your application.
